# jupyter-Ai-model
This ai model is trained  to predict the male- female life expectancy ratio.
This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow to predict the female-to-male life expectancy ratio using a Decision Tree Regressor. It processes a dataset containing life expectancy ratios across different countries and years, and evaluates the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
